# Laravel Aurora Connector ðŸ“®

This library creates a new database driver for Laravel dedicated to connect to Aurora. It gives us an opportunity to properly configure the READ COMMITTED isolation as well as
load the database password from AWS Secrets.

# Installation

```bash
composer require customergauge/aurora
```

# Usage

In the `config/database.php`, we define a connection using the `aurora` driver

```php
'tenant' => [
    'driver' => 'aurora',
    'host' => env('DB_HOST'),
    'port' => env('DB_PORT),
    'database' => env('DB_DATABASE'),
    'username' => env('DB_USERNAME'),
    'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
    'collation' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
    'prefix' => '',
    'prefix_indexes' => true,
    'strict' => false,
    'engine' => null,
    'options' => [],
    'aurora' => [
        'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_NAME'),
    ],
],
```
You also need set a region inside `config/aws.php` to be able register AWS Secret Manger Client, 
this configuration is necessary to set fallback if for some reason the extension or container is not working.

```php
return [
    'region' => env('AWS_REGION'),
    ...
];
```


The new 'aurora' key will allow the confiugration for the AWS Secret manager.

### Isolation Levels 
By default we allow Aurora to use read committed from the read replica to reduce history length maintained by the writer replica.
If you want to turn it off, go in the `database.php`, inside the connection that you want and add

```php
        'tenant' => [
            'driver' => 'aurora',
            'isolation_level' => 'off'
            ...
        ],
```

### AWS Lambda Extension

This library performs better together with a cache server, more info: https://github.com/cgauge/aws-secretsmanager-caching-extension
